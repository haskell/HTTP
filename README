DESCRIPTION

This is the Haskell HTTP and Browser module package. It was originally
written by Warrick Gray and the original version is still available
from: http://homepages.paradise.net.nz/warrickg/haskell/http/

The version 4 rewrite to have the user be able to control how the
requests and response payloads are represented, incl. the accommodation
of the use of @ByteString@s (lazy and strict) was inspired in part by
Jonas Aadahl et al's experimental work on @ByteString@'ifying the HTTP 
package a couple of years ago.

This only supports HTTP; it does not support HTTPS.

REQUIREMENTS

* A Haskell implementation such as GHC (http://www.haskell.org/ghc/)
or Hugs (http://www.haskell.org/hugs/) with support for Cabal.

INSTALLATION
