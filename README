A Haskell HTTP and Browser module package, originally written by Warrick Gray.

The version 4 rewrite to have the user be able to control how the
requests and response payloads are represented, incl. the accommodation
of the use of @ByteString@s (lazy and strict), was inspired in part by
Jonas Aadahl et al's experimental work on @ByteString@'ifying the HTTP
package a couple of years ago.

This only supports HTTP; it does not support HTTPS. Attempts to use
HTTPS result in an error.
